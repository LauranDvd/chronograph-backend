dislike,Try more without soruces,"Okay, I understand. You want a list of Romanian presidents, and you'll provide me with snippets of information that *might* be relevant. I will only use those snippets if they directly contribute to the answer. Let's focus on the presidents themselves.

Here’s a list of Presidents of Romania, from the modern era:

1.  **Nicolae Ceaușescu** (1974-1989): He was the last communist leader of Romania before being overthrown and executed during the 1989 revolution.
2.  **Ion Iliescu** (1990-1996): He led Romania after the fall of Ceaușescu, initially as interim president. He won two subsequent elections.
3.  **Emil Constantinescu** (1996-2000): He was elected in 1996, marking a transition away from Iliescu's rule.
4.  **Ion Iliescu** (2000-2004): Iliescu returned to the presidency for a third term.
5.  **Traian Băsescu** (2004-2012): He served two terms, though his second was interrupted by an impeachment process.
6.  **Klaus Iohannis** (2012-present): Currently serving as President of Romania.
